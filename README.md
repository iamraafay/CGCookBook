Earlier this year I started writing some CoreGraphics based drawing code. I always wanted to draw a character using CG. I kind of achieved it with this codebase, drawn Mr. Mario. It's still incomplete. Please take a look and feel free to contribute back or fork it! :)


The Core Graphics framework is a C-based API that is based on the Quartz advanced drawing engine. It provides low-level, lightweight 2D rendering with unmatched output fidelity. You use this framework to handle path-based drawing, transformations, color management, offscreen rendering, patterns, gradients and shadings, image data management, image creation, masking, and PDF document creation, display, and parsing.
